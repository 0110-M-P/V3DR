# V3DR Delta Printer
The V3DR began as a simple variant to RichRap's popular RepRap 3DR printer, but it quickly evolved into this ground-up redesign. Though I put a lot of time and effort into this design, RichRap still deserves all the credit for the original inspiration and design of this printer.

How is the V3DR different than the RichRap's original 3DR?
