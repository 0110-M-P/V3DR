# V3DR Delta Printer
The V3DR began as a simple variant to RichRap's popular RepRap 3DR printer. It quickly evolved into this ground-up redesign to address several issues with the original design. With that said, I feel obliged to give RichRap all credit for the original inspiration and design of this printer.

How is the V3DR different than the RichRap's original 3DR?
- Uses a GT2 belt drive system
- Uses V-slot extrusions for linear motion
- Accepts standard 8" diameter filament spools
- Accepts a heated bed
- Uses cheaper mechanical end stops
- Uses E3D V6 Lite hotend
- Direct drive MK8 bowden extruder
- Compatible with multiple electronic controllers and LCD's

Specs:
- Build Volume = 150 Diameter x 165mm Tall
- Overall Dimensions (w/ spool) = 262mm x 237mm x 600mm (10.3"x9.3"x23.6")
- Total printed part volume = ??? cubic centimeters
