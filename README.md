# V3DR Delta Printer by 0110-M-P
The V3DR is began as a simple variant to RichRap's popular RepRap 3DR printer. It quickly evolved into this ground-up redesign to address several issues with the original design. With that said, I feel obliged to give RichRap all credit for the original inspiration and design of this printer.

How is the V3DR different than the RichRap's original 3DR?
- Uses a GT2 belt drive system.
- Accepts standard 8" diameter filament spools.
- Accepts a heated bed.
- Uses cheaper mechanical end stops.

Specs:
Build Volume = 150 Diameter x 160mm Tall
Outside Dimensions = XxYxZmm
Total printed part volume = X cubic centimeters
